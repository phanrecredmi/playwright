## How to Use MPLAB XC8 PRO Compiler
 
Once you have installed MPLAB XC8 PRO compiler, you can use it to create and build your PIC microcontroller projects. You can use MPLAB X IDE, a free and integrated development environment that supports all Microchip devices, or other compatible tools, such as MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC), MPLAB Harmony or Arduino IDE. You can also use command-line tools to compile your code.
 
To use MPLAB X IDE, you need to create a new project and select the device, tool and compiler that you want to use. You can then write your code in C or assembly language, or use MCC to generate code for peripherals and libraries. You can also configure various options and settings for your project, such as optimization level, memory model, linker script and include paths. You can then build your project and generate a hex file that can be programmed into your device.
 
To use command-line tools, you need to invoke the xc8 command with the appropriate options and arguments. You can specify the source files, device name, output format, optimization level and other parameters. You can also use makefiles to automate the compilation process. You can then use a programmer tool, such as MPLAB IPE or PICkitâ¢ 4, to program your device with the hex file.
 
## How to Activate MPLAB XC8 PRO License
 
MPLAB XC8 PRO compiler comes with a free 60-day trial of a PRO license for evaluation purposes. The PRO license enables you to use all the optimizations and features of the compiler, such as procedural abstraction, loop unrolling and function inlining. The PRO license also gives you access to technical support and updates from Microchip.
 
To activate the PRO license, you need to register your compiler with Microchip using your myMicrochip account. You can do this online or offline. Online activation requires an internet connection and a valid email address. Offline activation requires a license key file that you can obtain from Microchip website or email.
 
To activate online, you need to launch the MPLAB XC License Manager from the Start menu (for Windows) or the Applications folder (for Mac OS). You can then click on the "Activate" button and enter your myMicrochip credentials. You will receive an email with a confirmation link that you need to click on. You can then restart your compiler and enjoy the PRO features.
 
To activate offline, you need to visit  and log in with your myMicrochip account. You can then select "MPLAB XC Compilers" from the "Products" menu and click on "Get License". You will see a list of available licenses for your compiler. You can then select the "PRO" license and click on "Generate Key". You will receive an email with a license key file attached. You can then save the file on your system and launch the MPLAB XC License Manager. You can then click on the "Activate" button and browse to the license key file. You can then restart your compiler and enjoy the PRO features.
